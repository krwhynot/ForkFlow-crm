## 🚀 **USAGE INSTRUCTIONS**

### **Quick Start**
```bash
# Setup (one-time)
npm install
npx playwright install
npx playwright install-deps

# Start development server
npm run dev

# Run tests
npm run test:e2e                    # All tests
npm run test:e2e:mobile            # Mobile tests
npx playwright test tests/accessibility/  # Accessibility tests
```

### **Debugging**
```bash
npx playwright test --headed       # Visual debugging
npx playwright test --ui           # Interactive test development
npx playwright test --debug        # Step-by-step debugging
```

---

## 📈 **EXPECTED OUTCOMES**

### **Immediate Benefits**
- **Test Reliability**: Consistent, reproducible results
- **Development Velocity**: Faster feedback cycles
- **Quality Assurance**: Comprehensive UI validation
- **Accessibility Compliance**: ADA/WCAG ready

### **Long-term Impact**
- **User Experience**: Superior mobile and accessibility experience
- **Maintainability**: Well-documented, scalable test framework
- **Compliance**: Ready for accessibility audits
- **Performance**: Optimized loading and interaction times

---

## ⚠️ **IMPORTANT NOTES**

### **Environment Requirements**
The only remaining challenge is Playwright browser execution, which requires:
```bash
npx playwright install
npx playwright install-deps
```

This is environment-specific and may need system administrator privileges in some deployment environments.

### **Browser Dependencies**
If tests still timeout after installation, the system may need additional dependencies:
```bash
# Ubuntu/Debian
sudo apt-get install libnss3 libatk-bridge2.0-0 libdrm2 libxcomposite1 libxdamage1 libxrandr2 libgbm1 libxss1 libasound2

# Or use Playwright's auto-installer
sudo npx playwright install-deps
```
