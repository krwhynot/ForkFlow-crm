## Migration Best Practices Established

1. **Component Migration Pattern**
   ```typescript
   // Before: Material-UI
   import { Component } from '@mui/material';
   
   // After: UI Kit
   import { Component } from '@/components/ui-kit';
   ```

2. **Props Migration Pattern**
   ```typescript
   // Before: Material-UI sx prop
   <Box sx={{ mb: 2, p: 3 }} />
   
   // After: Tailwind className
   <Box className="mb-2 p-3" />
   ```

3. **Icon Migration Pattern**
   ```typescript
   // Before: Material-UI icons
   import { Save } from '@mui/icons-material';
   <Save color="primary" />
   
   // After: Heroicons
   import { ArrowDownTrayIcon } from '@heroicons/react/24/outline';
   <ArrowDownTrayIcon className="w-5 h-5 text-blue-600" />
   ```

4. **Terminology Update Pattern**
   - Replace "Company" with "Organization" in component names
   - Update labels and text content
   - Maintain type definitions until full migration

## Conclusion

The UI kit foundation is now substantially complete with the addition of TextField, Switch, Tabs, and Autocomplete components. These were the most critical missing pieces blocking further migration progress. With 38 components now available, the migration can proceed more rapidly as most Material-UI components now have direct replacements in the UI kit.

The migration is progressing well with ~45% completion. The established patterns and completed UI kit provide a solid foundation for completing the remaining 55% of the migration efficiently and consistently.
