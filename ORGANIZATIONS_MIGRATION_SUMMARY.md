## üß™ Testing Instructions

### 1. Apply Database Migrations

**Option A: Supabase CLI (Recommended)**
```bash
# Create local Supabase instance
supabase init
supabase start

# Apply migrations
supabase db reset
supabase migration up
```

**Option B: Supabase Dashboard**
1. Go to SQL Editor in your Supabase project
2. Copy and paste content from each migration file
3. Execute in order:
   - `20250705000001_init_organizations_schema.sql`
   - `20250705000002_enable_rls_policies.sql`

### 2. Start the Application
```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

### 3. Verify Migration
1. **Navigation**: Check that "Organizations" appears in header menu
2. **CRUD Operations**: 
   - Navigate to `/organizations`
   - Create a new organization
   - Edit an existing organization
   - Verify organization show page works
3. **Relationships**:
   - Create contacts linked to organizations
   - Verify breadcrumbs show correct organization links
   - Test activity logging displays organizations correctly

### 4. Data Migration (if needed)
If you have existing data in a `companies` table:
```sql
-- Example data migration (run after schema migration)
INSERT INTO organizations (
    name, email, phone, address, city, 
    business_type, created_at, updated_at
)
SELECT 
    name, email, phone, address, city,
    business_type, created_at, updated_at
FROM companies;

-- Update foreign key references
UPDATE contacts SET organization_id = (
    SELECT o.id FROM organizations o 
    JOIN companies c ON c.name = o.name 
    WHERE contacts.company_id = c.id
);

-- Verify and then drop old table
-- DROP TABLE companies;
```
