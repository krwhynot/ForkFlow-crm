Hello Claude,

We are working on a React-based CRM application called ForkFlow-CRM. The primary goal of our recent work has been to migrate the entire user interface from Material-UI to a modern, headless UI stack. The new stack consists of Headless UI for accessible components, Tailwind CSS for styling, Tremor for charts, and Heroicons for icons.

We have systematically worked through a detailed migration plan and have completed the following major steps:
1.  **Login Page Migration:** Replaced all Material-UI components on the login page with our new `ui-kit` components.
2.  **Dashboard Migration:** Migrated all dashboard widgets, including charts (replacing Nivo with Tremor) and lists, to the new stack.
3.  **Resource View Migration:** Migrated the "Customers" resource list, which involved creating custom Table, Checkbox, and Filter components to replace the `react-admin` Material-UI-based components.
4.  **Layout Migration:** Replaced the main application layout and header, which were based on `react-admin`'s `RaLayout` and Material-UI's `AppBar`, with a custom layout built with Tailwind CSS and a Headless UI dropdown for the user menu.
5.  **Dependency Cleanup:** Uninstalled all Material-UI and Emotion packages (`@mui/material`, `@emotion/react`, `@emotion/styled`, `@mui/icons-material`).
6.  **Documentation Update:** Updated all relevant markdown files to remove references to the old UI stack.

**The Current Issue:**

Despite completing all the planned migration steps and fixing several subsequent bugs, the application fails to render. When we launch the development server and open the application in the browser, we are met with a blank white screen.

Here are the issues we have already diagnosed and fixed:
*   **`styled_default is not a function` error:** This was caused by an unmigrated `UniversalLoginPage.tsx`. We have rewritten this component using our new `ui-kit`.
*   **Vite Server Crash:** The dev server was crashing due to an import of a deleted component (`LoginSkeleton.tsx`) in `SignupPage.tsx`. We have removed this import and migrated the `SignupPage.tsx` as well.
*   **"Unknown at rule @tailwind" CSS errors:** This was due to an incorrect `postcss.config.cjs`. We have corrected the configuration to properly include `tailwindcss` and `autoprefixer`.
*   **Incorrect HTML entry point:** The `index.html` was pointing to an old `script.tsx` file. We have corrected it to point to `src/index.tsx`.
*   **Missing CSS import:** The main `index.css` file was not being imported. We have added the import to `src/index.tsx`.
*   **`react-admin` Theme Issue:** The `Admin` component in `src/root/CRM.tsx` was still being passed a `theme` prop based on Material-UI's `defaultTheme`. We have removed the `theme` and `darkTheme` props.

After all these fixes, the Vite server starts without errors, and the browser console is clean, yet the application still renders a blank page. This suggests a critical JavaScript error is occurring during the initial render, preventing the React application from mounting correctly.

**Your Task:**

Please analyze this situation in detail. Given the extensive migration and the "blank screen" symptom with no console errors, what is your primary hypothesis for the root cause of this issue?

Provide a step-by-step plan to diagnose and resolve the problem. Your plan should be methodical and help us uncover any subtle issues we might have missed during the migration from a component library that was deeply integrated with `react-admin`.
