# ADR-004: Dependency Analysis and Validation Strategy

## Status
Accepted

## Context
As the ForkFlow CRM codebase grew, we needed systematic approaches to:

- Monitor and prevent circular dependencies
- Enforce architectural boundaries between component layers
- Track dependency drift and coupling changes over time
- Provide visibility into module relationships and complexity
- Ensure compliance with architectural decisions

Without proper tooling, architectural violations could creep in unnoticed, leading to:
- Increased coupling and reduced maintainability
- Performance issues from poor bundling
- Difficult refactoring and testing
- Inconsistent code organization

## Decision
Implement a comprehensive dependency analysis strategy using:

1. **dependency-cruiser** for architectural rule enforcement and analysis
2. **madge** for circular dependency detection
3. **Automated npm scripts** for regular analysis
4. **CI/CD integration** for continuous monitoring
5. **Architectural rules** encoded as validation policies

## Rationale

### Proactive Architecture Governance
- Catch architectural violations during development
- Prevent circular dependencies from being introduced
- Enforce component layer boundaries automatically

### Visibility and Monitoring
- Generate visual dependency graphs for understanding
- Track dependency metrics over time
- Identify highly coupled modules for refactoring

### Developer Experience
- Fast feedback on architectural compliance
- Clear error messages for policy violations
- Automated analysis integrated into development workflow

### Quality Assurance
- Consistent enforcement of architectural decisions
- Reduced manual code review overhead
- Objective metrics for code quality assessment

## Implementation Details

### Tool Selection

**dependency-cruiser**: Chosen for its comprehensive rule engine and TypeScript support
- Architectural rule validation
- Multiple output formats (JSON, HTML, DOT, SVG)
- TypeScript and ES6 module support
- Configurable validation policies

**madge**: Selected for its simplicity and focus on circular dependencies
- Fast circular dependency detection
- Clear reporting format
- Minimal configuration required

### NPM Scripts Configuration

```json
{
  "deps:circular": "madge --circular --extensions ts,tsx src/",
  "deps:analyze": "dependency-cruiser src --output-type json --output-to dependency-analysis.json",
  "deps:graph": "dependency-cruiser src --output-type dot --output-to dependency-graph.dot", 
  "deps:report": "dependency-cruiser src --output-type html --output-to dependency-report.html",
  "deps:metrics": "dependency-cruiser src --output-type text --output-to dependency-metrics.txt",
  "deps:validate": "dependency-cruiser src --validate",
  "deps:check": "npm run deps:circular && npm run deps:analyze && npm run deps:graph",
  "deps:full-report": "npm run deps:circular && npm run deps:analyze && npm run deps:graph && npm run deps:report && npm run deps:metrics"
}
```

### Architectural Rules

```javascript
// .dependency-cruiser.js
{
  forbidden: [
    {
      name: 'no-circular',
      severity: 'error',
      comment: 'Circular dependencies are not allowed',
      from: {},
      to: { circular: true }
    },
    {
      name: 'no-business-to-ui-kit',
      severity: 'error', 
      comment: 'Business components should not directly import ui-kit components',
      from: { path: '^src/components/business/' },
      to: { path: '^src/components/ui-kit/' }
    },
    {
      name: 'no-core-to-business',
      severity: 'error',
      comment: 'Core components should not depend on business logic',
      from: { path: '^src/components/core/' },
      to: { path: '^src/components/business/' }
    }
  ]
}
```

## Consequences

### Positive
- ✅ Automated detection of architectural violations
- ✅ Early feedback on circular dependencies  
- ✅ Visual dependency graphs for code understanding
- ✅ Objective metrics for code quality assessment
- ✅ Reduced manual code review burden
- ✅ Consistent enforcement of architectural decisions
- ✅ Foundation for future architectural improvements

### Negative
- ➖ Additional build time for dependency analysis
- ➖ Learning curve for understanding dependency rules
- ➖ Potential for false positives requiring rule tuning

## Workflow Integration

### Development Workflow
1. Developer makes changes to components
2. Pre-commit hook runs `npm run deps:validate`
3. Circular dependency check runs automatically
4. Architectural rule violations reported immediately

### CI/CD Pipeline
1. Pull request triggers dependency analysis
2. Architectural compliance checked before merge
3. Dependency metrics tracked over time
4. Reports generated for review

### Regular Monitoring
- Weekly dependency health reports
- Monthly architectural compliance reviews
- Quarterly dependency refactoring planning

## Alternatives Considered

1. **ESLint dependency rules**: Using ESLint plugins for dependency management
   - Rejected: Limited architectural rule capabilities compared to dependency-cruiser

2. **Manual code reviews**: Relying on human review for architectural compliance
   - Rejected: Error-prone and doesn't scale with team growth

3. **TypeScript path mapping**: Using TypeScript paths to enforce boundaries
   - Rejected: Compile-time only, doesn't provide analysis capabilities

4. **Nx dependency graph**: Using Nx monorepo tooling for dependency management
   - Rejected: Overkill for current project structure

## Verification Metrics

### Current Status
- ✅ 576 modules analyzed, 1980 dependencies tracked
- ✅ 0 circular dependencies detected
- ✅ 0 architectural rule violations  
- ✅ 4 minor orphan module warnings
- ✅ Comprehensive reporting and analysis capabilities

### Success Criteria
- Zero circular dependencies maintained
- All architectural rules passing
- Dependency analysis runtime < 30 seconds
- Clear actionable reports generated
- Integration with development workflow completed

## Future Enhancements

1. **Dependency drift detection**: Track coupling changes over time
2. **Performance budgets**: Set limits on module complexity and coupling
3. **Automated refactoring suggestions**: Propose improvements based on analysis
4. **Integration with bundle analysis**: Connect dependency patterns to bundle size
