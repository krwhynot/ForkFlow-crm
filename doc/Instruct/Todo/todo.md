- [ ] **Fix circular dependency between authProvider and dataProvider**: Implement the solution strategy by creating a new shared module `src/providers/commons/userService.ts` to encapsulate data access logic needed by the auth provider, thereby breaking the direct circular import.
- [ ] **Create shared UserService module**: Develop `src/providers/commons/userService.ts` with a `UserService` class that takes `dataProvider` as a constructor argument and provides methods like `getUser` for user validation, as outlined in the dependency analysis report.
- [ ] **Update imports and eliminate circular reference**: Modify `authProvider.ts` to remove the direct import of `dataProvider` and instead instantiate `UserService` with `dataProvider`, ensuring that `authProvider` no longer directly depends on `dataProvider` for user validation logic.
- [ ] **Add automated circular dependency detection to CI/CD**: Integrate `madge` into the `package.json` scripts (e.g., `"deps:circular": "madge --circular --extensions ts,tsx src/"`) and ensure this check runs as part of the continuous integration pipeline to prevent future circular dependencies.
- [ ] **Split ui-kit index exports into domain-specific modules**: Refactor `src/ui-kit/index.ts` into more granular, domain-specific export files such as `ui-kit/forms/index.ts` for form components, `ui-kit/layout/index.ts` for layout components, and `ui-kit/data/index.ts` for data display components.
- [ ] **Reorganize component directory structure**: Create feature-specific component directories (e.g., `src/components/companies`, `src/components/contacts`) to improve modularity and maintainability, moving related components into their respective feature folders.
- [ ] **Implement consistent export patterns**: Establish and enforce consistent `index.ts` export patterns within each new component and feature directory to centralize exports and simplify import paths for other modules.
- [ ] **Update all import statements**: Systematically update all import statements across the codebase to reflect the new, reorganized component directory structure and the domain-specific `ui-kit` exports.
- [ ] **Add dependency analysis npm scripts**: Enhance `package.json` with scripts for comprehensive dependency analysis, including `"deps:analyze"` (using `dependency-cruiser`), `"deps:graph"` (for SVG output), and a combined `"deps:check"` script.
- [ ] **Create architectural decision records (ADRs)**: Document key architectural decisions, such as the circular dependency resolution (ADR-001) and UI Kit organization (ADR-002), detailing the decision, rationale, and alternatives considered.
- [ ] **Document component hierarchy and data flow**: Create comprehensive documentation outlining the application\'s component hierarchy (e.g., `App.tsx` -> `CRM.tsx` -> `Dashboard.tsx`) and the flow of data between different layers (UI, Business Logic, Data Providers).
- [ ] **Set up automated dependency drift detection**: Implement mechanisms to automatically detect and report changes in the dependency graph over time, ensuring architectural compliance and preventing unintended coupling.
- [ ] **Run full test suite before refactoring**: Execute `npm test` to ensure all existing unit and integration tests pass before initiating any refactoring efforts, establishing a baseline for changes.
- [ ] **Test specific components affected by circular dependency before refactoring**: Run targeted tests (e.g., `npm test -- --testPathPattern="auth|data"`) for `authProvider` and `dataProvider` to verify their current behavior before modifications.
- [ ] **Run E2E tests for critical user flows before refactoring**: Execute end-to-end tests for critical user authentication and data access flows (e.g., `npm run test:e2e:auth`) to confirm system stability prior to refactoring.
- [ ] **Verify no circular dependencies after refactoring**: After implementing the circular dependency fix, run `npm run deps:circular` to confirm that the circular dependency has been successfully eliminated.
- [ ] **Confirm all imports resolve correctly after refactoring**: Perform a full build (`npm run build`) to ensure that all module imports resolve correctly and there are no broken references due to the refactoring.
- [ ] **Full regression testing after refactoring**: Conduct a comprehensive regression test (`npm test && npm run test:e2e`) to ensure that the refactoring has not introduced any new bugs or regressions in existing functionality.
- [ ] **Component Style Consolidation (refactor files with 100+ classes)**: Identify and refactor components with high style complexity (e.g., `SlideUpModal.tsx`, `MultiStepOrganizationEdit.tsx`) by extracting common patterns into reusable components to reduce class count and improve maintainability.
- [ ] **Tailwind Optimization (review unique classes, implement stricter purging rules)**: Analyze the 1,337 unique Tailwind classes for optimization opportunities, implement stricter purging rules in the Tailwind configuration, and aim for a 20-30% reduction in bundle size.
- [ ] **UI Kit Cleanup (remove unused custom CSS utilities, consolidate overlapping component patterns, improve export organization)**: Remove the 5 identified unused custom CSS utilities, consolidate redundant or overlapping styling patterns within the UI Kit, and refine the organization of UI component exports for better clarity and efficiency.
- [ ] **Documentation (create comprehensive style guide, document component usage patterns, establish design token system)**: Develop a comprehensive style guide for the project, document common component usage patterns and best practices, and establish a design token system for consistent styling across the application.
- [ ] **Enhanced Accessibility (expand reduced-motion support, add more comprehensive color contrast options, implement automated accessibility testing)**: Further expand support for `prefers-reduced-motion`, introduce more comprehensive color contrast options to meet WCAG standards, and integrate automated accessibility testing into the development workflow.

### Design System Implementation

- [ ] **Update Tailwind CSS Configuration**: Modify `tailwind.config.js` to include the new color palette from `kitchen_pantry_wireframes.html`:
  - `primary`: `#2c3e50`
  - `secondary`: `#34495e`
  - `accent`: `#3498db`
  - `muted`: `#ecf0f1`
  - `background`: `#f5f5f5`
  - `foreground`: `#333333`
  - Priority colors: `A` (`#27ae60`), `B` (`#f39c12`), `C` (`#e67e22`), `D` (`#e74c3c`)
- [ ] **Update Global Styles**: In `src/index.css` or a similar global stylesheet, update the base styles to reflect the new design, including the `font-family` (`Segoe UI`), `line-height`, and `background-color`.
- [ ] **Create Reusable Components**: Develop a set of reusable components based on the wireframes, such as `DashboardCard`, `DataTable`, `QuickActionButton`, and `FormInput`, to ensure consistency across the application.

### Page Creation

#### Organization Page

- [ ] **Create `Organization` Component**: Create a new component at `src/components/organizations/OrganizationPage.jsx`.
- [ ] **Implement Data Table**: Use a data table component (e.g., from a UI library or a custom-built one) to display the list of organizations.
- [ ] **Implement Filtering**: Add dropdown filters for `Priority`, `Segment`, and `Distributor` that update the displayed data.
- [ ] **Implement Search**: Add a search input field that filters organizations by name in real-time.
- [ ] **Add "Add Organization" Button**: Include a button that links to a form for adding a new organization.

#### Contact Page

- [ ] **Create `Contact` Component**: Create a new component at `src/components/contacts/ContactPage.jsx`.
- [ ] **Implement Contact List View**: Display a list of contacts with their name, organization, and priority.
- [ ] **Implement Contact Detail View**: On clicking a contact, display a detailed view with:
  - Contact information (email, phone, LinkedIn)
  - Influence level and decision role
  - Recent interactions timeline
  - Active opportunities
- [ ] **Add Quick Action Buttons**: Include buttons for `Call`, `Email`, `Add Interaction`, and `Edit Contact`.

#### Placeholder Pages
