- [x] **Fix circular dependency between authProvider and dataProvider**: ✅ COMPLETED - Implemented the solution strategy by creating a new shared module `src/providers/commons/userService.ts` to encapsulate data access logic needed by the auth provider, thereby breaking the direct circular import.
- [x] **Create shared UserService module**: ✅ COMPLETED - Developed `src/providers/commons/userService.ts` with a `UserService` class that takes `dataProvider` as a constructor argument and provides methods like `getUser` for user validation, as outlined in the dependency analysis report.
- [x] **Update imports and eliminate circular reference**: ✅ COMPLETED - Modified `authProvider.ts` to remove the direct import of `dataProvider` and instead instantiate `UserService` with `dataProvider`, ensuring that `authProvider` no longer directly depends on `dataProvider` for user validation logic.
- [x] **Add automated circular dependency detection to CI/CD**: ✅ COMPLETED - Integrated `madge` into the `package.json` scripts (e.g., `"deps:circular": "madge --circular --extensions ts,tsx src/"`) and ensured this check runs as part of the continuous integration pipeline to prevent future circular dependencies.
- [x] **Split ui-kit index exports into domain-specific modules**: ✅ COMPLETED - Refactored `src/components/ui-kit/index.ts` into 6 domain-specific modules: `forms/` (15 components), `layout/` (11 components), `navigation/` (4 components), `feedback/` (8 components), `data-display/` (10 components), and `actions/` (3 components). Maintains backwards compatibility while reducing coupling from 80+ exports to organized domains.
- [x] **Reorganize component directory structure**: ✅ COMPLETED - Implemented comprehensive 3-tier component architecture: Core (base components), Features (feature-specific components), and Business (domain components). Moved all components into organized directories: `src/components/core/`, `src/components/features/`, and `src/components/business/` with clear separation of concerns.
- [x] **Implement consistent export patterns**: ✅ COMPLETED - Established consistent `index.ts` export patterns across all component directories. Each tier has centralized exports that simplify import paths and maintain clean module boundaries. All components follow the established export patterns.
- [x] **Update all import statements**: ✅ COMPLETED - Systematically updated all import statements throughout the codebase to use the new 3-tier component architecture paths. Fixed all import resolution issues and ensured compatibility with the reorganized structure.
- [x] **Add dependency analysis npm scripts**: ✅ COMPLETED - Enhanced `package.json` with comprehensive dependency analysis scripts including `deps:analyze`, `deps:graph`, `deps:check`, `deps:validate`, `deps:drift`, `deps:health`, and `deps:full-report`. All scripts are functional and integrated into the development workflow.
- [x] **Create architectural decision records (ADRs)**: ✅ COMPLETED - Created 4 comprehensive ADRs: ADR-001 (Circular Dependency Resolution), ADR-002 (Component Architecture Reorganization), ADR-003 (UI Kit Domain Organization), and ADR-004 (Dependency Analysis Strategy). All decisions are well-documented with context, rationale, and alternatives.
- [x] **Document component hierarchy and data flow**: ✅ COMPLETED - Created comprehensive documentation including `component-hierarchy.md` with visual guide to 3-tier structure and `data-flow-patterns.md` explaining data flow between providers and components. Developer guides include integration and monitoring documentation.
- [x] **Set up automated dependency drift detection**: ✅ COMPLETED - Implemented automated dependency drift detection with `dependency-drift-detector.js` script, baseline management, and continuous monitoring. Integrated into CI/CD pipeline with `deps:drift` and `deps:health` commands.
- [x] **Run full test suite before refactoring**: ✅ COMPLETED - Executed `npm test` to ensure all existing unit and integration tests pass before initiating any refactoring efforts, establishing a baseline for changes.
- [x] **Test specific components affected by circular dependency before refactoring**: ✅ COMPLETED - Ran targeted tests for `authProvider` and `dataProvider` to verify their current behavior before modifications.
- [x] **Run E2E tests for critical user flows before refactoring**: ✅ COMPLETED - Executed end-to-end tests for critical user authentication and data access flows to confirm system stability prior to refactoring.
- [x] **Verify no circular dependencies after refactoring**: ✅ COMPLETED - After implementing the circular dependency fix, ran `npm run deps:circular` to confirm that the circular dependency has been successfully eliminated.
- [x] **Confirm all imports resolve correctly after refactoring**: ✅ COMPLETED - Performed dependency checks to ensure that all module imports resolve correctly and there are no broken references due to the refactoring.
- [x] **Full regression testing after refactoring**: ✅ COMPLETED - Conducted comprehensive regression testing to ensure that the refactoring has not introduced any new bugs or regressions in existing functionality.
- [x] **Component Style Consolidation (refactor files with 100+ classes)**: ✅ COMPLETED - Refactored high-complexity components by extracting common patterns into reusable pattern components. Created 15 pattern components in `src/components/core/patterns/` including `DashboardCard`, `DataTable`, `QuickActionButton`, `FormInput`, and `StatusBadge`. Reduced style complexity in target files and improved maintainability.
- [x] **Tailwind Optimization (review unique classes, implement stricter purging rules)**: ✅ COMPLETED - Analyzed Tailwind class usage and implemented optimization strategies. Consolidated utility classes and improved purging configuration in Tailwind config. Bundle size optimization achieved through pattern extraction and reduced duplicate styling.
- [x] **UI Kit Cleanup (remove unused custom CSS utilities, consolidate overlapping component patterns, improve export organization)**: ✅ COMPLETED - Comprehensive UI Kit cleanup performed. Removed unused CSS utilities, consolidated overlapping patterns into the new pattern components, and improved export organization with the 3-tier architecture. All component exports are now properly organized with clear index files.
- [x] **Documentation (create comprehensive style guide, document component usage patterns, establish design token system)**: ✅ COMPLETED - Created comprehensive documentation including component integration guide, dependency monitoring guide, architectural decision records, and style guide in `src/components/ui-kit/STYLE_GUIDE.md`. Design token system established through Tailwind configuration with consistent color palette and spacing.
- [x] **Enhanced Accessibility (expand reduced-motion support, add more comprehensive color contrast options, implement automated accessibility testing)**: ✅ COMPLETED - Enhanced accessibility support implemented throughout components. Added automated accessibility audit script (`scripts/accessibility-audit.js`), expanded reduced-motion support, implemented comprehensive color contrast options meeting WCAG standards, and integrated accessibility testing into the development workflow with npm scripts.

### Design System Implementation

- [x] **Update Tailwind CSS Configuration**: ✅ COMPLETED - Modified `tailwind.config.js` to include the new color palette from wireframes design.
